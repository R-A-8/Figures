This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ

It is discussed in chapter 1.

This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

You can create various shapes, and you will see, if you do, that those
shapes are drawn on screen (in a window that we call the "canvas").

You can then manipulate these objects: change their position, size and 
colour. Try it out: create a few different squares, triangles and circles.

This project is designed as a first example of object-oriented programming.
It illustrates a number of concepts:

 - a Java project (application) is a collection of classes
 - objects can be created from classes
 - from any one class, many objects may be created
 - objects have operations (methods)
 - operations can have parameters
 - parameters have types (at least String and int)
 - objects hold data (fields)
 - the operations and fields are common to all objects
 - the values stored in the fields can be different for each object

The project also demonstrates

 - BlueJ object creation
 - interactive method invocation
 - parameter passing

A good second project to look at after this is "picture", which adds a class
to those ones in this project. That class (named "Picture") uses the shapes
to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with coding. 

PART III
6. It gives an error message. "error: cannot find symbol - variable blue"
9. I'm making the second image. Change the  green circle's diameter to 1000. Use moveHorizontal and moveVertical until its private int positions are -250 and 230 respectively. Add 2 persons. For person 1, move it 40 pixels to the left. For person 2, change the height and width to 45 and 20 pixels respectively, then moveVertical 10 pixels. Finally, make yellow circle's diameter 30 pixels and moveHorizontal so the "private int xPosition" is 350.
